# Install Apache + PHP + PostgreSQL + pgAdmin with Docker

_Note: links given here are for descriptive purposes and for detailed information. \
You don't need to download anything here, all is done automagically for you. Just run the commands. \
With one exeption of course: you should have cloned this project and you have Dockerfile ready._

* Open up Ubuntu terminal

* Navigate to project directory \
  _https://github.com/Kambyses/bible_ \
  `cd /home/$USER/apache-php`

* Build apache-php docker image \
  `docker build -t apache-php .`

* Install & run apache-php docker container \
  _https://hub.docker.com/_/php/_ \
  `docker run --name apache-php -d -p 8080:80 apache-php`

* Install & run PostgreSQL + PostGIS \
  _https://hub.docker.com/r/mdillon/postgis/_ \
  `docker run --name postgresql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d mdillon/postgis`

* Install pgAdmin \
  _https://hub.docker.com/r/fenglc/pgadmin4/_ \
  `docker run --name pgadmin --link postgres:postgres -p 5050:5050 -d fenglc/pgadmin4`

### Some explanations

`--name` parameter defines the name for running container. \
You can run as many parallel services as your like as long as you give them unique names. \
If you don't name the container at all, docker does it for you.

`-p` parameter defines the port mapping. \
For example `-p 8080:80` specifies that port `80` should be mapped to port `8080` on the host machine. \
It will fail if port 8080 is not available, so keep your containers running on different ports.
Choose high number ports as lower maybe blocked or in use by the host system.

### Usage

* What's my web address and port?
```
# Inspect apache-php
docker inspect apache-php

# locate parameters:
# IP aadress: HostConfig -> PortBindings -> HostIp  or  NetworkSettings -> Networks -> bridge -> IPAddress
# Port:       HostConfig -> PortBindings -> HostPort
```

* What's my database host, port, name, user and password?
```
# Inspect postgresql
docker inspect postgresql

# locate parameters:
# host:      NetworkSettings -> Networks -> bridge -> IPAddress
# port:      NetworkSettings -> Ports
# database:  Config -> Env -> POSTGRES_DB
# username:  Config -> Env -> POSTGRES_USER
# password:  Config -> Env -> POSTGRES_PASSWORD
```

* What's my website and database ip address and port if i want to access them from windows?
```
# Inspect Ubuntu IP config
/sbin/ifconfig

# Locate exposed Ip aadress from there.
# It should look something like that:
# ens33     inet addr:192.168.182.132
# You ports should still be the same as on Ubuntu.
# Defaults are 8080 for web server and 5432 for PostgreSQL
